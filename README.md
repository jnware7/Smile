#Welcome to Smile!
Smile is a quote sharing platform that makes you smile. 

To start the app you'll need to install a few things. Lets start with the app itself which is located at:
$ git clone https://github.com/jnware7/Smile.git

Next we'll add the dependencies: <br>
`$ npm i `

After everything has been installed you'll need to initialize your database luckily we've written a script for that:<br>
`$ npm run db:create`

Next you'll want to get your server started:<br>
`$ npm start`

And finally open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000
